# Food eco stats API

Get metrics on the environmental impact of food products.

## Background

It's no secret that our climate is changing, and food production is one of the biggest contributors. From greenhouse gas emissions, to water usage, to fertilizer run-off into water sources, agriculture and livestock farming play a major role in our health and climate.

Check out these statistics from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food)

> - Food accounts for over a quarter (26%) of global greenhouse gas emissions<sup>1</sup>;
> - Half of the worldâ€™s habitable (ice- and desert-free) land is used for agriculture;
> - 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are used for agriculture<sup>2</sup>;
> - 78% of global ocean and freshwater eutrophication (the pollution of waterways with nutrient-rich pollutants) is caused by agriculture<sup>3</sup>;
> - 94% of mammal biomass (excluding humans) is livestock. This means livestock outweigh wild mammals by a factor of 15-to-1.<sup>4</sup> Of the 28,000 species evaluated to be threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List, agriculture and aquaculture is listed as a threat for 24,000 of them.<sup>5</sup>
